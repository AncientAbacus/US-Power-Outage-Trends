## Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis



## Assessment of Missingness


## Hypothesis Testing
For the portion where we had to conduct hypothesis testing, we completed two tests, a hypothesis test and a permutation test. <br />

### Hypothesis Test <br />
Null: The frequency of a particular climate category is not an indicator of when an outage occurs <br />
Alternative: Warmer climate categories are a better breeding ground to have power outages <br />

### Permutation Test <br />
Null: The state of California experiences the same frequency of power outages as the rest of the country <br />
Alternative: California power outages and power outages for the rest of the country come from two different distributions <br />
